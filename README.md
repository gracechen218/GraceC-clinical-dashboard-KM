# ðŸ“Š KM Survival Dashboard (R Shiny)

This is a web-based Shiny app for interactive Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.  
Users can upload their own clinical dataset and dynamically generate KM curves, filter by parameters, and view survival estimates at key time points (0, 30, and 180 days).

  - Censoring indicator
  - Grouping variable
  - `PARAMCD` filter (e.g., Death, MAE, HFH)
- Interactive Kaplan-Meier curve using `ggplot2` + `plotly`
- Summary survival probability table at 0, 30, and 180 days
